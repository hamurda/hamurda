## 👋 Hi, I’m Damla

I’m learning to engineer intelligent systems using **LLMs, RAG pipelines, and agentic AI frameworks**.  
My focus is on building small, real-world tools to deeply understand how large language models reason, retrieve, and interact with tools.

### 🧭 What I'm Doing Now

- 🧠 Practicing **LLM engineering** by building agents, chatbots, and summarization tools using OpenAI, HuggingFace, and LangChain  
- 🔬 Exploring **agentic workflows** with OpenAI’s Agents SDK and custom tools  
- 🔧 Working as a software engineer on backend projects involving Django, Spring, React and more  
- 🛠️ AWS Certified Developer Associate  
- 📐 Former vibration & acoustics engineer now building in software

### 💬 Try My Live Chatbot

Interact with an AI assistant that uses **LangChain RAG + OpenAI + Gemini** to retrieve relevant answers, evaluate tone and regenerate responses when needed.
